# Implementing an Arithmetic Carry Logic Unit (ACL Unit) in Logisim Evolution

## Step 1: Create the Circuit

1. **Open Logisim Evolution**:
   - Start by launching Logisim Evolution.

2. **Create a New Circuit**:
   - Go to `File` > `New` to create a new circuit.

## Step 2: Add Input Pins

1. **Add Input Pins for the Numbers**:
   - Add two **16-bit input pins** for the two numbers you want to operate on (let's call them `A` and `B`).
   - You can set the width of the input pins to 16 in the properties panel.

2. **Add Control Input**:
   - Add a **1-bit control input pin** to select the operation (e.g., 0 for addition and 1 for subtraction).

## Step 3: Implement the Subtraction Logic

1. **Use a 2's Complement for Subtraction**:
   - To perform subtraction using addition, you can use the 2's complement method. This involves inverting the bits of `B` and adding 1.
   - Add a **NOT gate** for each bit of `B` to invert the bits.
   - Add a **constant value pin** set to 1 to represent the carry-in for the addition.

## Step 4: Create the Full Adder Circuit

1. **Add Full Adders**:
   - If you have already created a full adder circuit, you can use it here.
   - Place **16 full adders** in your circuit.

## Step 5: Connect the Full Adders

1. **Connect the Inputs**:
   - For each full adder:
     - Connect the corresponding bit of `A` to the first input.
     - Connect the corresponding bit of the inverted `B` (from the NOT gates) to the second input.
     - Connect the carry-in from the previous full adder (for the first full adder, connect the carry-in to the constant value pin set to 0 for addition and 1 for subtraction).

2. **Control Logic**:
   - Use a **multiplexer (MUX)** to select between the original `B` and the inverted `B` based on the control input:
     - If the control input is 0 (addition), connect `B` directly to the full adder.
     - If the control input is 1 (subtraction), connect the inverted `B` to the full adder.

## Step 6: Add Output Pins for the Result

1. **Add Output Pins**:
   - Add **16 output pins** for the result (let's call them `S`) and label them S0 to S15.
   - Add one output pin for the final carry-out (Cout) and connect it to the Carry-out of the last full adder.

## Step 7: Test the Circuit

1. **Set Input Values**:
   - Use the `poke` tool to set different values for the 16-bit inputs `A` and `B`, and set the control input to test both addition and subtraction.
2. **Observe Outputs**:
   - Check the output pins (S0 to S15) and the Cout pin to ensure that the addition and subtraction are performed correctly.

## Example Connection for the First Few Bits

- **First Full Adder**:
  - Inputs: A0, (B0 inverted or B0), Cin (initially set to 0 or 1 based on operation)
  - Outputs: S0, Cout (to the next full adder)

- **Second Full Adder**:
  - Inputs: A1, (B1 inverted or B1), Cout from the first full adder
  - Outputs: S1, Cout (to the next full adder)

- Continue this pattern for all 16 bits.

## Final Notes

- Make sure to label all your components clearly for easier understanding.
- You can also add a reset button or other controls as needed.

This setup will allow you to implement an Arithmetic Carry Logic Unit (ACL Unit) that can perform both addition and subtraction of two 16-bit numbers in Logisim Evolution. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
